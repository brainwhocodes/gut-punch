# CLI Packaging Tasks

This document outlines the specific tasks needed to make the GutPunch CLI easy to integrate into other projects.

## Requirements

- Allow the CLI to be imported and used in other projects
- Support customization of CLI commands and behavior
- Provide a clean API for programmatic usage
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI usage

## Tasks

### 13. CLI Module Refactoring

- [ ] Separate CLI code into modular components
  - Extract command handlers into separate files
  - Create a unified command registry
  - Implement plugin architecture for custom commands

- [ ] Create a CLI factory function
  - Accept configuration options as parameters
  - Support custom command registration
  - Allow middleware integration for command preprocessing

- [ ] Implement programmatic API
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for all CLI operations
  - Add Promise-based API for all commands
  - Provide event emitters for operation status updates

### 14. Integration Improvements

- [ ] Create a reusable CLI integration package
  - Support importing as ES module and CommonJS
  - Provide TypeScript typings for all exports
  - Optimize bundle size for integration use cases

- [ ] Implement CLI extension mechanism
  - Allow host projects to register custom commands
  - Support command overriding for customization
  - Add middleware hooks for command preprocessing

- [ ] Add integration documentation
  - Create step-by-step integration guide
  - Document all extension points
  - Provide examples for common integration patterns

### 15. Output and Logging

- [ ] Refactor logging and output system
  - Make logging configurable and pluggable
  - Support different output formats (JSON, table, etc.)
  - Add silent mode for programmatic usage

- [ ] Implement progress reporting
  - Add support for long-running operations
  - Create progress events for tracking
  - Support cancellation of operations

### 16. Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Add integration tests
  - Test CLI as a library in different project types
  - Verify backward compatibility
  - Test extension scenarios

- [ ] Update CLI documentation
  - Document programmatic API
  - Provide examples for different usage patterns
  - Create an integration cookbook

## Completion Criteria

- CLI can be imported and used programmatically
- All commands work both in CLI and programmatic mode
- Extension mechanism allows custom commands
- Logging and output is configurable
- Integration documentation is complete and accurate
- Unit and integration tests cover all use cases
