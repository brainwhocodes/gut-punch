# Gut-Punch to Bun Migration Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the Gut-Punch project from Node.js to Bun runtime.

## Initial Setup
- [x] Create migration plan
- [x] Install Bun runtime
- [x] Create bunfig.toml configuration
- [x] Update package.json for Bun compatibility
- [ ] Install dependencies using Bun

## Runtime Adaptation
- [ ] Update Node.js-specific imports
  - [ ] Replace `node:fs` imports with Bun-compatible alternatives
  - [ ] Replace `node:path` imports with Bun-compatible alternatives
  - [ ] Replace `node:url` imports with Bun-compatible alternatives
- [ ] Update file system operations
  - [ ] Replace Node.js-specific file operations with Bun equivalents where beneficial
  - [ ] Test file I/O performance with Bun
- [ ] Update process management code
  - [ ] Review and update any process spawning or management code

## Build System Migration
- [ ] Evaluate build options
  - [ ] Test Vite compatibility with Bun
  - [ ] Evaluate Bun's built-in bundler as an alternative
- [ ] Update build configuration
  - [ ] Modify Vite config for Bun compatibility (if keeping Vite)
  - [ ] Create Bun-specific build scripts (if switching to Bun bundler)
- [ ] Test build process
  - [ ] Verify CJS output format works correctly
  - [ ] Ensure proper handling of multiple entry points (jobs, CLI)

## Testing Migration
- [ ] Configure Bun's test runner
  - [ ] Ensure test environment matches Vitest configuration
  - [ ] Configure coverage reporting
- [ ] Update test scripts
  - [ ] Replace Vitest commands with Bun test commands
  - [ ] Update any test utilities for Bun compatibility
- [ ] Run existing tests
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass with Bun's test runner
  - [ ] Fix any test-related issues

## CLI Adaptation
- [ ] Update CLI implementation
  - [ ] Ensure Commander.js works with Bun
  - [ ] Test CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Update CLI scripts
  - [ ] Replace Node.js execution with Bun execution
- [ ] Test CLI commands
  - [ ] Verify all CLI commands work as expected

## Database Integration
- [ ] Test Drizzle ORM with Bun
  - [ ] Verify SQLite drivers work with Bun
  - [ ] Test database operations
- [ ] Update database-related code if necessary
  - [ ] Address any compatibility issues
  - [ ] Test migrations with Bun

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Leverage Bun's performance features
  - [ ] Optimize file I/O operations
  - [ ] Use Bun-specific APIs where beneficial
- [ ] Measure performance improvements
  - [ ] Compare startup time
  - [ ] Compare job execution speed
  - [ ] Compare memory usage

## Final Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Document any changes or improvements
- [ ] Update README with Bun-specific instructions

## Notes
- Keep track of any issues encountered during migration
- Document any workarounds or solutions for future reference
- Compare performance metrics before and after migration
