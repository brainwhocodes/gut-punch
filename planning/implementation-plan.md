# Implementation Plan: GutPunch CLI Integration

This document outlines the plan to make the GutPunch CLI configurable and reusable, allowing it to be integrated into other projects with custom configuration and SQLite database integration.

## Overview

The goal is to refactor GutPunch so that:
1. The CLI can be integrated into other projects as a dependency
2. Configuration is read from a YAML file specified by the host project
3. The CLI can hook into an existing SQLite database in the host project
4. Task completion tracking is implemented

## Approach

We'll follow a modular approach with these phases:

1. **Refactor Configuration Management**: Make the configuration system more flexible and externally configurable
2. **Core Refactoring**: Improve code quality, use enums, and simplify the Scheduler.
3. **SQLite Database Integration**: Create adapters to work with external databases
4. **CLI Packaging Improvements**: Make the CLI easy to integrate into other projects

## Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1. Refactor Configuration Management | 3 days | None |
| 2. Core Refactoring | 2 days | 1. Refactor Configuration Management |
| 3. SQLite Database Integration | 2 days | 2. Core Refactoring |
| 4. CLI Packaging Improvements | 2 days | 2. Core Refactoring |
